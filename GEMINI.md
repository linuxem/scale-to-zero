## Intended Use
Based on the directory name `scale-to-zero`, this workspace is likely intended for:
- **Serverless Architecture:** Projects involving Functions as a Service (FaaS) or scale-to-zero patterns.
- **Kubernetes Autoscaling:** Configurations for tools like Knative or KEDA that enable scaling pods to zero when idle.
- **Resource Optimization:** Scripts or tools designed to minimize infrastructure costs by idling unused resources.
